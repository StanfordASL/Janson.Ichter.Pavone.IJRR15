As a function of maze dimension d:

START = [1./6, 1./6, ..., 1./6, 1./6]
END = [1./6, 1./6, ..., 1./6, 5./6]

OBSTACLE COVERAGE = 1 - (2^(d+1) - 1)/3^d
i.e. = 2/9 for d = 2
	 = 4/9 for d = 3
	 = 50/81 for d = 4
	 ...
	 = 96.5% for d = 10

For fixed dimension, the obstacle coverage could be tuned to be whatever you need it to be, but I haven't bothered to implement that.
